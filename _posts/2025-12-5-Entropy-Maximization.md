In this post, I derive the density function that achieves maximum entropy from the first principle.

Let us consider a complex random vector $x \in C^{n}$ with zero mean and satisfies $E\{xx^{+}\}=Q$. Then, the entropy of $x$ satisfies $H(x)<=log(det(pi \mult e\mult Q))$ with equality if and only if x is a circularly symmetric complex Gaussian random vector with zero mean and covariance Q.
